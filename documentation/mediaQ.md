## Explanation of Media Queries

### 1. `@media screen and (min-width: 1024px)`
- **Meaning**: Applies styles when the **screen's width is 1024 pixels or more**.
- **Effect**: Ensures specific styles are applied on **large devices**, like laptops or desktops. For example, layout changes to better utilize the larger screen space.

### 2. `@media screen and (min-height: 721px)`
- **Meaning**: Applies styles when the **screen's height is 721 pixels or more**.
- **Effect**: Customizes styles for **taller screens**, which might affect vertical spacing or height-based elements like `.home__container`. This is often used to make content look better on larger monitors or tall displays.

### 3. `@media screen and (min-width: 768px)`
- **Meaning**: Applies styles when the **screen's width is 768 pixels or more**.
- **Effect**: Typically used for **tablets** or medium-sized devices, adjusting layouts like grids or fonts to suit their dimensions better.

### 4. `@media screen and (max-width: 320px)`
- **Meaning**: Applies styles when the **screen's width is 320 pixels or less**.
- **Effect**: Meant for **very small devices**, like older phones, where layout elements (e.g., `.home__img`) are resized to fit the tiny screen properly.

## Which Media Query is Irrelevant?

The **`@media screen and (max-width: 320px)`** media query is likely irrelevant for most modern web designs because:

1. **Devices with screen widths of 320px or smaller are extremely rare today.**  
   - Most smartphones now have widths starting from **375px or more**.
   
2. **Maintaining such a narrow query adds unnecessary complexity.**  
   - Unless your target audience specifically uses older devices, this query may have little to no impact.

## Why to Avoid It?
This media query increases complexity without significant benefits, as the majority of users wonâ€™t encounter this breakpoint. Instead, focus on broader breakpoints like `max-width: 375px`, which are better suited for modern, smaller devices.
